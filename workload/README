This folder defines the platform we deploy onto every workload cluster. It forms two parts:

- workload/flux-system: this directory contains the bootstrap for installing flux on the workload cluster. This is
  generated code from the flux command line and would likely be generated by CI.
- workload: this contains the infra we deploy onto the node.
